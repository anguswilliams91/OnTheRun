# OnTheRun
Fast stars in SDSS

#To do:

- [x] Run test with LSR velocity of 220km/s instead of 240km/s
- [x] Run test with 250km/s cut instead of 200km/s
- [x] Re-run models with default settings (powerlaw, flattened powerlaw, TF with Gibbons prior) 
- [x] Write Introduction
- [x] Write Conclusions
- [ ] Process changes from other authors
- [ ] Add bit to conclusion about accretion history being encoded in k (we are doing this)
- [x] Add bit to justify the transformation of vesc(r) - > M(r), cite Piffl
- [ ] Explain why our statistical uncertainties are larger than Piffl's (because we allow large range of k)
